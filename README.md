## 🚀 About Me
I am a passionate Software Engineer specializing in Backend Development, Data Science, and AI-Driven Solutions. With over 18 years of experience, including more than 4 years focused on AI and ML, I have developed scalable applications, implemented intelligent agents with **LangChain** and **LangGraph**, and deployed robust backend architectures using **FastAPI** and **microservices**.  

My expertise includes working with **Python**, **Java**, **Node.js**, and **Solidity**, building **RESTful APIs**, and creating customized **AI chatbots with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**. I have experience with **graph databases** like **Neo4j** and **Memgraph** for structured and unstructured data, and since May 2021, I have explored **AI image generation** using **VQGAN+CLIP** in Google Colab.  

I thrive on tackling complex challenges, optimizing machine learning models, and pushing the boundaries of technology. I'm actively looking for opportunities to join forward-thinking teams that value growth, collaboration, and innovation in **AI**, **ML**, and **data-driven solutions**.
